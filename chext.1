.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chext
is a simple shell utility for adding, removing, and changing filename extensions, where an extension is the last substring in a filename to begin with a period.

.B chext
accepts one or more files and a single extension as arguments.
Files may be specified individually or as regex.

.B mv
is used to perform the actual movement of files to their new filenames.
As such, the file arguments may be absolute paths, relative paths, or a mix of both absolute and relative paths.

File arguments without any current extension will have
.I extension
appended to them.

Removing extensions is done by passing
.I extension
as an empty string ("").

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i interactive
Prompt the user for confirmation before renaming a file over an existing file.
.TP
.B -v verbose
Show the source and destination filenames as
.B chext
renames files.
